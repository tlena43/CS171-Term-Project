## Description of Question and Research Topic
Electronic and household waste are growing environmental challenges that require smarter sorting and recycling systems. Our project explores how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can classify different types of waste images to improve automated recycling efficiency. Samriddhi focuses on identifying ten types of **electronic waste** (e.g., TV, battery, circuit board), while Helena focuses on **general recyclable waste** (e.g., plastic, glass, organic). By comparing model performance and confusion matrices, we aim to determine how computer vision can support real-world waste management pipelines. This work demonstrates the role of machine learning in promoting sustainability and reducing landfill impact.

## Project Outline

### Data Collection

### Samriddhi Matharu
- **Dataset:** *E-Waste Image Dataset* (~3,000 labeled images across 10 classes, Apache 2.0 License).  
- Data is pre-organized into `train/val/test` folders.  
- Preprocessing steps include loading images using `ImageFolder`.  
- Resize images, convert to tensors, and normalize pixel values.  
- Apply light augmentation (flip, rotation) to increase variety and help prevent overfitting.

### Helena Thiessen
- **Dataset:** *Waste Recycling Plant Dataset* (~3000 labeled images across 17 classes).
- Research datasets pertaining to recycling and select one of interest.
- The sourced data is split into training and validation sets.
- Some categories may need to be combined or removed to narrow down to the desired categories.
- Data must be read into python and stored as tensors.
- Labels must be read into python and properly processed.
- Using pytorch data must then be normalized, and augmented to reduce overfitting.

### Model Plans

### Samriddhi Matharu
- Use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify e-waste images into 10 categories.  
- The model will include convolution, ReLU activation, and pooling layers to extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.  
- We plan to adjust the number of layers and filters to see how they affect performance.  
- Evaluate results using accuracy and loss curves, and visualize model predictions with a confusion matrix.

### Helena Thiessen
- Use a **Region Based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN)** to the presence of recylcing items of given classes.
- Research R-CNN's in pytorch
- Iplement a custom backbone
- Use custom backbone with pytorch FasterRCNN object
- Finetune backbone with varying arrangements of pooling layers, convolutional layers, linear layers, and dropout layers
- Finetune model by trying different activation functions and gradient descent algorithms
- Train model and assess results on test data
